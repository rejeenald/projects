The look of Superman Returns, while beautiful and streamlined, doesn&#039;t feel the way a Superman epic should. The lighting was never right and so everything looked dull and grey. The characters had little or no depth, with Superman showing no sign of anything resembling a personality and Lex Luthor&#039;s trademark cunning and meticulous scheming replaced with an over-the-top plan that carried no degree of subtlety or credibility. Overall, it was a good film, but not a great one. We could&#039;ve had a great superhero film and it would&#039;ve been X3. Instead we get two mediocre films marred forever by missed opportunities.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

By leaving the X Men franchise and going to this one, we have two mediocre super hero movies that 'underperformed' in the box office. Superman Returns seemed to have everything...great production values, great casting (Brandon Routh and Kevin Spacey) and a passionate film maker in the form of Mr Singer himself. But by making this a 'sequel' of some sort to Dick Donner's SUPERMAN, Singer pinned himself into a corner.  Face it, despite how brilliant Spacey is, Richard Donner's portrayal of Lex Luthor was crap. And for crying out loud, as much as I like Kate Bosworth, she is the worst Lois Lane in cinematic history. Superman Returns, beside  a really great set piece in the middle of the film, felt slow and 'too serious' for its own good. The critics may like it, but the audience didn't.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Directed by Bryan Singer the movie is certainly faithful to the originals and for the most part Brendon Routh is able to recapture the charm that made Christopher Reeve so popular in the role even if there never quite seems to be the same level of chemistry with Kate Bosworth’s Lois Lane.<br/><br/>The movies plot is perfectly passable, largely thanks to an excellent performance from Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, despite the fact that we never really learn anything more about the man of steel as the film progresses. Even if Superman has never been as interesting a superhero as Batman for example a little more insight into what had happened over the last five years would have still been nice.<br/><br/>Overall, while it can perhaps be a little slow in places, thanks to some well shot action scenes and good performances Superman Returns is a worthy addition to the franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It was a unique reboot that recaptured the charm of the classic movies while moving forward into new territory. Routh as Clark Kent channeled Reeves brilliantly. It might have reignited the franchise if it had contained a few more epic action scenes for the audience that found it boring. As a coming of age tale, a man becoming a father, it delivered...but it lacked the bombastic action that superhero movies usually feature and there was rarely a sense of threat. I really enjoyed it for what it was but, after lots of discussions, can understand why many of the people who saw it were disappointed. It's a shame, if only Lex had recruited an actual supervillian Routh might still be Superman instead of the Atom.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Having said that it doesn&#039;t mean that this turkey of a movie gets a free pass as most of you giving it a ten are doing. The script was awful, the acting wooden, except for Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, and the directing even worse. The cast was fine but now that they are back they need something to work with.

The movie completely lacks originality and I found myself on more than one occaision laughing with such gusto at the corny dialogue and leaps in logic, that I nearly had to leave the theatre. I cannot believe that any studio would have spent 200M on a franchise movie with a script this poorly written, and overacting that would embarass a Soap Opera cast, (Kevin Spacey&#039;s Lex Luthor excluded). With Spiderman, Batman Returns, and X-men having raised the bar for super hero movies, I expected so much more. Instead I was treated to a movie that ripped of the original throughout, stole from several other action flicks for it&#039;s story line, and did nothing to develop the characters at all. This is movie making at it&#039;s worst.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

SR however is one of the most forgettable movies of all time. some scenes were okay, So? I also hate the fact that each time we saw superman fly, it was a fake superman, as in, it was a digital reproduction, not the actual actor. I therefore could not connect with superman at all. i connected with chris reeves, because it was him doing the flying and he did it beautifuly. bottom line...they messed up...big time!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This serve no purpose and way too late, after the fourth one. The fourth one was such a dumb Saturday morning cartoon. this movie tries be to like Batman Begins, still doing the family friendly series, which it didn't work. This should have been a reboot, instead a suppose sequel. Bryan Singer is not that great of a director. The only Singer film I like is Valkyrie. I don't hate this, this is just a middle- of-the-road-film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Sadly, in many respects, Bryan fails. While the film has some interesting concepts, it's unfortunately more of the same old. In many ways, the film blatantly borrows from the first two classics, without trying to add anything new to the series it's continuing. One thing the film does give the audience is a fantastically campy performance delivered by Kevin Spacey who clearly seems to be enjoying himself.<br/>Overall the film asks us Does the world need Superman ?<br/>It doesn't need this film, that's for sure. The film just lacks the spectacle and wonder you would expect in a Superman film<br/>55/100</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Brandon Routhe looked too young and wasn't the best choice for the man of steel, but I got the impression that he was at least trying. I didn't like how Lois Lane was written and I don't think Kate Bosworth was a good choice, she looked like a teenager. Kevin Spacey was a decent Lex, but his 'diabolical plan' wasn't very smart. There could of been more action scenes and I kinda wish the film embraced the colors of the Richard Donner movies.

Sure there are some weak spots but overall i d say that it had the same tone as the Reeves Superman. On the downside Luther's plot to get rich with real estate again left me with a deja vu feeling. Wasn't that the premise of the first Reeves movie? A little originality would have been nice. Otherwise, I found that the acting was solid, the action was a bit lacking but was effective when shown.<br/>The fact that Superman learns he has a son would also have been something to work with in a sequel but that never happened.

He comes off as a bore, yes, we get it, he's tortured and hasn't returned from Krypton in over 5 years, but where's the joy? Where's the enthusiasm? He just seems like the kind of guy who would try to smile in front of a camera, but ultimately just exposes his teeth with a blank expression, and the picture would just look awkward.<br/><br/>Kate Bosworth, who was 22 at the time, plays Lois Lane who has a child that is 5 years old...she does not look like someone who should have a child that's 5 years old. She seems shocked that Superman has (as the title suggests) returned, but is mad at him for leaving in the first place.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey plays the ever-so-threatening Lex Luthor, he has charisma and seems to be the only one giving the most effort in his performance, but he's a cartoon...his presence and his appearance make him more animated than a Pixar film.<br/><br/>Overall, this is bleak, dry and underwhelming. I applaud Singer for trying to bring some cinematic life back to the iconic character, but the franchise needed a reboot...fresh and different, not an overdue sequel where it feels like a carbon copy of previous installments.<br/><br/>There's promise, but there's disappointment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie is absolutely unforgivable! Not just disappointing, not just average, but terrible! As expected, the CGI was great--good thing too, because the story was nonexistent. Nonetheless, an iconic screen shot here and there does not a movie make. Here are but a few of the problems:<br/><br/>1. The need for Superman's return is necessitated by the hero's 5 year leave of absence from earth, during which time, he presumably travels to Krypton in order to confirm its destruction. I say "presumably" since we never get to see any of this search, only a rehashed CGI effect of Krypton exploding. If you're going to use a return to Krypton as a plot device--and its an intriguing idea--develop it! Dont' leave it hanging there like an unzipped fly.<br/><br/>2. Lex Luthor is about as threatening as Star Jones in a verbal joust with Barbara Walters. The movie opens with him swindling an old widow out of her fortune. Are you shaking in your boots yet? Isn't this guy supposed to be the smartest guy on the planet? Sigh...I suppose the screenwriters, out of some misguided desire to one-up Hackman's original performance, decided complete emasculation of Superman's nemesis was the only route to go. Kudos on that guys! Oh yeah, and in case you missed the point that this guy has no penis, the movie made sure to show Parker Posey literally dump his "crystals" into the ocean. At least that was less painful than witnessing the relentless zinging of the movie's villain with "you're bald" jokes.<br/><br/>3. Lois Lane and Routh are as flat as pancakes. There is no emotional depth to the characters at all. I guess the writers realized this when they were penning the script because, a la "Family Ties", "The Cosby Show", "Phantom Menace", or "Full House", they decided to hide their faltering story by turning Lois Lane's 5 year old kid into a major character. As expected, this was typical bait and switch. Bring out the kid everytime we need a tear. And, for extra effect, lets make him speech impaired and only utter things like "Mommy, will he get better? I want him to get better."<br/>Get my gun.<br/><br/>4. Luthor's plan to destroy Superman starts off well--steal Kryptonian technology and use it to conquer the world and kill Superman--but leaves something to be desired in the execution. Luthor uses a crystal from the Fortress of Solitude to create a new continent--one based on the crystaline geology of Krypton. OK, so far. What now? Build some kick-ass Kryptonian weapons? Revive some long-dormant Kryptonian A.I. that runs amok? Build a suit of Kryptonian battle armor to give Supes a run for his money? None of the above. If you said, kick back, smoke a cigar and play a couple of hands of No-Limit Texas Hold-Em, you'd be more on the right track. Yawn...<br/><br/>5. What else? Oh yeah. Lois has a live-in boyfriend played by X-Men's James Marsden. If only they had let Marsden unleash a well-placed optic blast to eleviate the mind-numbing boredom of watching him squirm from one insecurity complex to the next. I guess I can't blame the guy. If I knew my girlfriend's ex was the last son of Krypton, I'd probably be a little uneasy too. However, all sympathy for the character quickly evaporates as he is remorselessly turned into a Women's Sensitivity Seminar Poster Boy.<br/><br/>6. In the end, I didn't know what to be irritated by the most--the film's inability to engage me in any way by the story, or its heavy-handed attempts to endorse some limp-d--k vision of the sensitive, modern man.<br/><br/>There has been some recent attention surrounding the question, "Is Superman Returns a gay film"? I don't think "gay" quite hits the mark on this one. Rather, terms like "limp", "flacid",and "impotent" come to mind.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7466098"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Overall, Superman Returns is the sort of force that's irrational, yet is ironically able to gain value by being aware of itself. What's meant by this is that the irrationality in question is perhaps that it's acceptable to oppose self-awareness without reason, and that the source of this dynamic isn't meant to be understood.<br/><br/>Possessing self-awareness is a type of division, ergo a type of conflict. So from this definition, what can be projected onto Superman Returns is the formula that the source of being self-aware is the irrational, but, because that source was always inevitable that means that it's okay for an outcome of purity to derive from the act of self-awareness. Of course, the next problem that leads from this is that if Superman Returns is a process of getting to purity, is that meant to suggest that the movie itself is an evil product?<br/><br/>Even if Superman Returns isn't evil per se, on the basis that evil is true, that still leaves the worrying and disturbing idea that Superman Returns is partly evil incarnate. Which makes sense, given that the story does feel very eerie, and very poignant and about impending doom. But then again, if the story is about impending doom, that provokes the great idea in which Superman Returns can be understood as a perfect encapsulation of a trade of identities: the story is about impending doom, and therefore the external product possessing the story being the process to purity is a very neat and very impressive reality. The probability, is that Superman Returns is indeed what's just been described. It doesn't seem far-fetched or out of place to perceive Superman Returns this way, but, there is then a new issue that arises: if this identity of purity for evil is real, is it worthwhile to point out that it's possible that this nature is a justification for the movie? If the justification is real, perhaps it's just a consequence of the story that the complexity isn't able to deal with the justification. After all, the purity that's ostensibly linked to the product isn't an actual part of the experience, not even when Kal-El visits Jason at the movie's very end, and so it seems fair game to think of Superman Returns as a type of failure. Failure, in this sense, isn't negligible but it also isn't important. The fact is that Superman Returns is a tremendous emotional experience, and frankly represents a much better type of art and philosophy of film-making than most other superhero and fantasy movies do. In the world of Superman Returns, the mundane and the common are the special and the supernatural. The typical human experience is the value of the story, the clear pattern of the story being the link between complexity and uniformity.<br/><br/>In Superman Returns, spectacle derives from uniformity, but link between spectacle and uniformity is the theme of the movie rather than just some accidental byproduct. The supernatural nature of uniformity being possible is the movie's spiritual essence, and this is the sort of story depth that far outshines many other sci-fi classics. It's a crime that Superman Returns never got a sequel, but at the same time it isn't any wonder from an artistic perspective, similar to Batman & Robin.<br/><br/>At the end of Batman & Robin, Barbara Wilson joins Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson to become a trio of superheroes; because of this intellectual development, it isn't a surprise that Batman & Robin never got a sequel, because the conceptual specialness of Batman, Robin and Batgirl was too precious to actually manifest. Superman Return was the exact same reality, ending on such a conceptually exciting and emotionally uplifting note that the prospect of any sequel to Superman Returns would've been daunting to say the least. Superman Returns has its flaws, but the real heart of its brilliance is that those flaws are in fact part of the very things that make Superman Returns an infinite case of magnificence</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Indeed, "Superman Returns" excelled in sheer spectacle, but it was disappointing in several key areas: First, the basic plot was a retread of the first Superman: 1) Lex&#039;s lust for land (think "beachfront property"); 2) Lex&#039;s conflicted lady sidekick (think "Valerie Perrine") 3) Superman being weakened by Kryptonite and in the water (right out of the subway scene in the first movie). These are a few examples of Singer so intently trying to reflect the first movie that he begins to copy it. Second, it isn&#039;t the case that there is a duality between Superman/Clark. There are three people in there, apparently: Superman/Real Clark/Buffoon Clark. The real "corn fed" Clark we have come to know through better development in "Smallville" and the buffoonish Clark that is the favorite personna of the Donner films (save for the few minutes we see Clark return home in the beginning of the film). Even here, Clark isn&#039;t the nice young man as he is a bit mean to his dog. Perhaps it is intentional that Superman comes across more as the Clark we respect, and that the Buffoon Clark seems to be truly alien. Why should Lois be attracted to buffoon Clark? Perhaps this transposition justifies Lois&#039; infatuation with Superman. Third, Superman uses his powers in truly creepy ways in the movie. It really isn&#039;t OK that Superman spies on Lois and her boyfriend in her home, and I must say that "Richard" came across as more truly heroic, because without any special powers (not even mutant ones) he exhibited a heck of a lot of courage to protect his family. Amazingly, I&#039;m not sure this was intended. In contrast, Superman came across as more of a force of nature than human. The messianic overtones and overt references by Superman to this aspect of his personna seemed incredibly self-serving and unneccessary. Having written these things, I must say that the visual effects (particularly the jet crash and the bullet scene - you know which one I mean) were spectacular (though one has to wonder who would actually think that civilians would actually be allowed to fly on a shuttle launch vehicle - the implausibility of this plot turn boggles the mind! Perhaps the administration saw it as a way to dispense with some pesky reporters...). I&#039;ve read comics for 30 years, and have faithfully attended just about every comic-related movie that has been put forth, and there have been some bad ones. To me, Superman isn&#039;t Superman because of his powers - it is his humanity, caring for others and capacity for self-sacrifice that makes Superman unique. Apparently, to Singer, Superman is Superman because of his powers. He is a messiah, not because of his essential kernal of humanity, but because in a god-like way he can apparently defy the laws of physics. Perhaps the tone of this first movie was necessary to set the stage for better things to come, but it was not the home run I had anticipated.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I enjoyed this movie greatly. I really dug Jimmy Olsen, Frank Langella as Perry White and Brandon Routh did a great job as Superman (although I still consider him too young for the part and much to "Superboyish" to be the "man" of steel). His voice is very, very Chris Reeve like and I thought he did a pretty good job. The icing on the cake however was Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor...Yowzah! He gets the Metropolis baddie down pat and I think is the best Luthor...period. What a great choice for the part! He dominated this film IMO. The let down...Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane. Just ain&#039;t happening gang. Also, the whole thing with the "kid"...unneeded and merely a plot twist used by the diretor.

The introduction of a child is stupid, seemingly commandeered by the class of actors going past their prime in recent times and all popping out little kids. The Clarke Kent persona is underplayed. Superman doesn&#039;t interact with the world enough, like he&#039;s an observer rather than superhero. The lifting continent of kryptonite to space scene was bulls*** (for a very obvious reason). Parts of it are good, but it falls well short in other areas (the Kid....the KID)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Lex Luthor&#039;s evil scheme makes almost no sense, and the internal consistancy of such major elements as the way kryptonite affects superman is very questionable. In the end, the film veers away from all of its earlier hints at greatness, and delivers a poorly-timed, drawn out version of exactly what we&#039;ve seen before in old superman movies. It&#039;s not bad, but it leaves me questioning the reasons for a remake.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

While Brandon Routh is an absolute revelation as Superman - the screen lights up when he&#039;s on it - the story (was there one? I can&#039;t recall) is so flimsy that it can&#039;t support the worthwhile religious imagery. I was so excited to see what they would do with the notion of "Why the World Doesn&#039;t Need Superman"... the idea that the world doesn&#039;t need a savior. The movie doesn&#039;t really show us what this means - we don&#039;t get to see with our own eyes how Lois might have come to this conclusion, except as a girl nursing a broken heart. There&#039;s a larger picture here - one I would like to have seen. And, with the exception of a few lines referring to how the world DOES need a savior, SUPERMAN RETURNS doesn&#039;t show us why Lois&#039;s mind is changed by the end of the film. Do we ever actually get to see real people in real crisis? There&#039;s a silly bank robbery scene that serves the purpose of showing off Superman&#039;s ability to repel bullets, and the ill-conceived robbery of the Museum of Natural History... but none of the scenes of folks "in danger" (mostly shown in a montage) really connect us with the notion of needing/ wanting/ or rejecting a savior. For all the Christ poses and references to events like Christ&#039;s resurrection, the writers really didn&#039;t seem to be involved in linking the images to an actual narrative. The pacing drags because the director seems to be so in love with his effects that he luxuriates in them. We see the same thing (the land formations Lex has conjured) over and over again - we get it! What&#039;s more, who cares? We need to see people we care about in danger, not just hear that "billions" will die. And finally - as for the scene in which Lois is on Lex&#039;s yacht - again, "in danger" - this is one of the most limp sequences I&#039;ve seen in a superhero film. It drags. As for casting - poor Kate Bosworth. She&#039;s gone without eating all these years... and for what? So she can co-star in a disappointing big budget extravaganza and be criticized as one of the weakest links (which she was)? So, given that she looks 20, 21... are we to assume she was a teenage mother? Babies having babies. Tsk. Tsk. Shame on you, Superman. Seems like what you did is illegal in most states. Next time, cast a woman - not a girl who has the body of a pre-adolescent boy - to play Lois Lane. Someone who is worthy of Brandon Routh&#039;s gaze. While the effects guys earned their paychecks here, the screenwriters did not - there&#039;s no story to support the $200 million plus effects extravaganza that is Superman Returns. It&#039;s a shame Superman isn&#039;t real. Maybe he could have saved this picture.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

And, for once in current movies, everyone acts like a decent person (except, of course, the villain). To put it another way, unlike most such movies, they act like adults. And everyone ends up doing the right thing. As one reviewer remarked, it&#039;s the most truly adult superhero movie ever. And not in the sense of being unpleasant and dark like the over-rated Batman Begins.

Whoever concocts these kinds of films must not give any respect for the viewer&#039;s intelligence, attempting to make up something merely to distract the audience from its blatant errors from top to bottom. This isn&#039;t film, this is like watching a two and a half hour commercial with no real plot, but a purpose to gain one&#039;s attention long enough to justify the money you spent in the theater.

He played the part brilliantly, and his one-lined puns were right on target, but physically, he didn&#039;t portray Lex, at least not the lex i know from legend. In short, Brian did a wonderful job in this remade version of Superman, just as he did with X-Men, The visual effects were good, as they say, you did believe a man could fly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The subtext in this movie that "we all have the ability to be supermen" was rather poignant, I thought. This movie fails in many areas though. First, it takes way too long to get the story going. Second, it lacks continuity. If this movie is supposed to take place where Superman II left off (apparently, Bryan SInger thinks III and IV didn&#039;t exist), then why did he leave for 5 years? If you recall Superman II, Superman leaves Metropolis to go to the Fortress of Solitude with Lois Lane. In order to be with her he has to give up his powers and he does. While this is going on Zod and his crew are reaking havoc and taking over the world. Superman finds out what&#039;s going on, gets his powers back "(I&#039;ve been...lifting weights."), realizes he has to sacrifice a relationship with Lois and live out his destiny as mankind&#039;s protector. At the end of the movie he meets the president and sys, "I won&#039;t let you down again." That being said, why the heck did he take off for 5 years? My third problem with this movie is that it&#039;s even more ridiculous that no one knows Clark is Superman than it was 26 years ago. For God&#039;s sake, besides the fact that they look exactly the same and have all of the same physical characteristics (which Richard White pointed out) don&#039;t any of those characters find it a bit coincidental that they both left 5 years ago and came back the exact same day?! Another problem--and my wife pointed this out-- If you never saw the first 2 movies or don&#039;t know much about the Superman charcter, this movie (although wasting about an hour trying to) does not fill in any blanks or explain any canon. Bryan SInger apparently forgot that Superman II was released in 1980. The biggest problem with this movie is 2 fold: This a clone of the Richard Donner Superman movies. The characters are almost exactly the same as they were 26 years ago with nothing new brought to them by the actors that play them (and I still don&#039;t understand why Clark Kent has to be a clumsy dork. I don&#039;t recall the comics ever portraying him that way.). Lex is a little more vicious, but still not a whole lot different than Gene Hackman&#039;s Lex and the cliched girlfriend (Kitty Kowalski) played by Parker Posey is the exact same as every other girlfriend he&#039;s ever had. She&#039;s ditzy, does whatever Lex tells her, tries to seduce Superman in order to distract him and has second thoughts in the end about Lex&#039;s sinister plans. Sound familiar? She even dresses like them. The worst part of the Richard Donner clone aspects of this movie is the recycled plot (which, as I noted earlier takes them forever to get to). Lex wants to use Superman&#039;s powers to take over the world. Again, does that sound familiar? I did like the Superman junior subplot, but I had it figured out immediately, it, as the irony was so obvious. I know this review sounds like I &#039;m bashing this film, but I&#039;m really not, I&#039;m looking at it objectively as an avid movie goer. I don&#039;t understand Tina B.&#039;s pseudointellectual &#039;Christ in a cape&#039; reference whatsoever. That is about as ridiculous as The Advocate claiming Superman is a homosexual and that everytime he comes out a phone booth, he&#039;s coming out of the closet. First of all, I&#039;d like to explain something to both Tina B. and The Advocate. Superman is a fictional character. The point of Superman (even in this movie) is to inspire us to our own greatness, symboliziing what we can be so that we can prevent what happened to his world happening to ours. He&#039;s not meant to be our savior and his sexual preference (I think it&#039;s kind of obvious he&#039;s straight, though) is irrelavent. It is quite obvious to me that SInger and company were less concerned about story/plot/character development and more concerned about the renaissance of the franchise and making a ton of money, kind of like Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Batman Begins, it ain&#039;t. I&#039;ll give them a pass this time, but I certainly hope that the next offering is akin to Star Trek II: The Wrath Khan as far as quality is concerned. For family fun and decent entertainment, I would recommend this film. For anything more substanitive, I would not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The basic plot is a little to reminiscent of the original Superman in which Luthor is still obsessed with the idea of creating land for himself to sell to others. It was a sort of midway between the modern comic book Luthor who is a billionaire megalomaniac and the original movie Luthor who was a bit of a goof ball and insane. Spacey, however, is great as Luthor. One thing that bugged me, and this is a bit of a spoiler, is Clark&#039;s apparent disregard for his mother, who is seen waiting for news in the crowd as the world waits to see if Superman has survived, yet he runs off to see Lois after he recovers rather than paying a visit to his mother, who so obviously worries about him even though he is practically a God.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Take for example the long sweeping shot that shows the audience how remote the Fortress of Solitude is and how much of a trek Luther and his cronies have to get there. Then when they arrive, they are all perfectly clean and dry as if they just walked out of their trailers. Where&#039;s the attention to detail by the director? The script has major problems too. Are we supposed to believe that all nations will bow down to Luther because he happened to start his montrous plan? Can he defend what he created? Can he claim it as his own after any country with a warhead and a thirst for land (uh, that&#039;s almost all of &#039;em these days) shows up and wants to claim it themselves? Finally, any time you are ever drowning in the freezing Atlantic waters for several minutes, don&#039;t think that you can just summon up the strength to overcome hypothermia. That&#039;s almost as plausible as getting tossed around in an aurplane going the sound barrier and not even get a scratch (oh wait that silliness happens in this film too). All this aside, the story of how much superman was missed (or wasn&#039;t) is a lame subplot in between the multitude of special effects scenes of Superman either catching something falling or picking somehting up and throwing it into space.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I don&#039;t think Superman is as dark as Batman was but then again I can see why Lois was really mad at him. Go and watch. You&#039;ll see. Overall this movie was entertaining in somewhat of a fresh way. Someone termed this a chic movie as far as action comic book films go. I can kind of see this too. Overall the acting was pretty good, not great. There were a few stilted moments but overall it was the effects that really mesmorized me. The flying scenes of Superman were superb. And the feats much more complex. There were a few new angles I didn&#039;t except going in. This movie showed a more obsessed alienated side to Superman. I kind of thought he was a bit of Jerk to tell you the truth, especially in one aspect toward Lois. But overall it comes across as an interesting angle I&#039;d like to see in potential sequels. I was surprise to see Kevin Spacy who is usually a first rate actor and overall had the look for Lex but didn&#039;t really convince me. Also I can&#039;t remember who played the editor of the daily planet, somewhat of a notable actor, however he played his role too muted down. He almost seemed depressed for me. They should have made him a little more angry and engaged in life. Again the best parts were Superman and Lois as far as acting goes. They did OK but not phenomenal. The special effects were incredible. And there were a few twists that I guessed earlier than I would have wanted that made me feel a little mixed. Overall worth seeing on the bigscreen but also not the best superhero movie ever to be made. I felt the Supermans&#039; with Reeves were a bit better in a different sort of way. This one however made me feel more philosophical so I&#039;d have to give it points for that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It&#039;s apparent the hack writers and Singer imbued their film&#039;s asinine plot with as much complexity and forethought as their villain did his-- just add water, no one will care, it&#039;s just a dumb summer movie for average, easily entertained fools anyway. Yes, Superman Returns is, for anyone not blinded by love for an iconic character and possessed of a modicum of intelligence, a failure of a film. The reasons are so many,and on so many levels, it is daunting to stare up at the mountain I have to climb in listing them. However, I must try, so as to purge my brain of the poison consumed last night at a Hollywood crap purveyor, er, Cineplex. From the macro to the micro, this movie is garbage. Macro: there is simply no jeopardy, no real sense of danger, ever. Everytime someone is in trouble, you just know that Superman will show up and lift whatever object needs to be lifted. That is a problem the character faces, granted, and one with which any filmmakers would be saddled. Yet the filmmakers are to be indicted for making almost every action beat require the lifting of some big object. This beat was so redundant. Superman lifts this, that, OKAY, I get it. Then, what was the point of that staccato, cheesily shot action sequence where Superman was shot in the chest and eye-- was it merely to show us what we already knew: he is bulletproof? You wasted money on that scene why? With all the realistic, heart-wrenching tragedy and crime in the world today, they show us some cartoonish gatling gun on a cherry-picker and some slo-mo bullets we&#039;ve seen a thousand times? Lame. The problem here is that the film&#039;s tone was at times serious, so then why this cartoonish gatling gun scene? Same for the over-the-top ham-fisted screenwriters&#039; &#039;distraction&#039; of Superman with the brake-less Mustang. Are we to believe that Lex just somehow KNEW Superman would be free to save Posey at that exact time? Why would Superman allow the one substance that can kill him to be so openly displayed in a museum? Why does he even work at The Daily Planet, if he is out to save people all the time-- what about all the people who die from tragedy and crime while he is wasting his time posing as a tool called Clark Kent? This whole character is tired and requires you to lower your IQ to stomach its conceits and contrivances. The villian&#039;s agenda in this film was the worst, most pathetic, absurd screenwriting creation of all time. Wasn&#039;t he already rich? Why not just hold the world hostage? Who would be left, after billions died, to spend money on and inhabit that hostile, spiky land mass Lex brought forth from the sea? How come PLANES stopped working when a tiny sliver of crystal was placed in water? It&#039;s not like planes and cars stop working in a BLACK OUT, for logic&#039;s sake. The film asks us to forget basic common sense and logic so much, but then it asks us to believe in tedious minutiae such as this: Lex is free because Superman wasn&#039;t available to GIVE TESTIMONY AT HIS APPEAL? What type of plebeian swallows this stupidity? Are we to believe that Superman has to testify at the trial of every criminal he apprehends? This is the best the highly paid studio development execs and writers and director and like ten producers could offer the public? Did anyone read the script b4 shooting? How could Lois and her husband see Superman&#039;s face in the roiling sea from such height in their plane? Wasn&#039;t the point of that beat that the child has SuperVision-- but then the parents see Superman below also. What a mess. Why doesn&#039;t Superman just kill Lex from above with an eye-ray or something at any random point-- oh, wait, because then there would be no film here. Another failure of the film is the casting; why do Superman and Lois look like they are 18 yrs old? Did she have that kid at 14? This wrecks the ability to invest in the story from the outset. It looked like the O.C. version of Superman. Olsen looked 12. How many times did Singer have to clobber us with stale, static visual exposition? Lois&#039; (ha) Pulitzer, Lex&#039;s metorite book, shots of newspapers. How many shots of that fake Daily Planet ball were there, 20? Why? Give it a credit. Superman was somehow able to carry a Kryptonite land mass all the way up to space? Huh? The filmmakers suspend and bend the rules of their world to serve their idiotic plot; they can&#039;t even color within their own lines. Are we to assume that Marsden&#039;s character doesn&#039;t suspect the child is not his? Wouldn&#039;t the world, at least some, suspect that some five years after her &#039;I Spent The Night With Superman&#039; article, with a five-year old child, the child might be Superman&#039;s? I guess everyone is as dumb as Perry White, with his reaction to that SOS fax (lucky that fax machine was handy!). Lois and Clark&#039;s reunion was so stale. Is that how good friends who haven&#039;t seen each other in five years act? Why is her kid always in the office, just because the filmmakers want to bludgeon us with the fact that it&#039;s Superman&#039;s kid? Why did Superman leave for 5 years without before checking (with a mere x-ray glance) if he got Lois pregnant (he had to know he didn&#039;t use protection)? Very callous of him. How weak and politically correct to cut out "and the American Way." How did Lois not get a scratch from that opening plane sequence? If they wanted to infuse their film with some verisimilitude and deepen their character, why not show how it&#039;s impossible for Superman to save everyone who needs saving at any given moment in time? Show us how hard it is for him to choose who to save. What a miss. As for those who&#039;d say, &#039;Easy, it&#039;s a summer movie. It&#039;s Superman.&#039; I respond this way: 250 million dollars and decades and you can&#039;t give us a tight, cogent story? Shame on everyone involved. When will the plebes who soak this stuff up get some standards and demand more?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Sadly, the end product is very disappointing and the plot? has more holes in it than quality Swiss Cheeze (sic). I would have hoped that they would have "borrowed" from the excellent character development of the Superman character from Smallville and made Superman more Human, more angsty (sic) and, well, more like a Marvel character than the namby-pamby goody two-shoes DC superheros; nah... See it on the big screen for some of the F/X, but don&#039;t be expecting to be impressed overall by the film. The true bright spot is Kevin Spacey.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie is just what I needed to set my spirit soaring out of the doldrums. Now, occasionally, an image comes flying out of my subconcious where I am standing in a pair of red boots and blue leggings on a golden cloud and feeling capable of anything. Most of the time, I just take pleasure in the idea that someone truly wonderful is there to help clean the stable. I loved the old Superman movies, and I love this one even more. Thank you Bryan Singer: please, please make those sequels soon and keep all of the actors on board--I thought they were great. Just wish you hadn&#039;t killed Kal Penn off, and I don&#039;t see how you can resurrect him now that he is crushed under a crystal and floating in outer space...maybe Superman could turn back time again? Probably not. Oh well. As you can see, I am very busy concocting scenarios for the next movie already, and I hope you, Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris are very busy doing the same thing. Good luck--I can hardly wait to see my hero again!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

If this isn&#039;t bad enough it takes about an hour and a half before anything significant happens. By then the movie has lost the audience and only gets more amateurish by the minute. It&#039;s ridiculous that about 1.75M of the budget is wasted on CGI which is nothing more than a fancy video game. If any of these yahoo&#039;s giving this joke of a movie a ten can honestly say that this is a perfect flick than either I&#039;ll show you a kid with ADD or a moron who checked his brains in at the door or had a lobotomy. This is a disgrace and boring as hell. Where do the studio&#039;s find these yahoo&#039;s who waste their money. I love Superman as much as the next person but it is the end of the line for me.

He is supposed to be the #1 hero that inspires the world and universe. Singerman is suicidal, depressive & seems to fear what Earthlings think of him. The relationship between Lois & Clark is a central theme to the Superman story. Lois knew Clark&#039;s identity before marrying him. This child angle is half-baked. Big blue has better villains than Luthor, where plots are limited. Kal can only fight the scheme & not the villain directly. Superman can&#039;t lift an island of kryptonite, and he has a S on his cape. The red on his suit is bright & inspiring not dull like in Returns. Singer calls himself a fan?

The visuals are stunning - some of the most riveting action sequences ever filmed - and the performances are spot-on. I could truly imagine the panels of one of my collected comics or graphic novels jumping from the page and coming to life on screen. The emotion found at the root of the story appropriately tugs at the heart-strings, while reminding the viewing audience why Superman should be an inspiration to us all. Singer has truly outdone himself, as this is easily rhe best all-around comic-to-film adaptation since the original Donner film. Where that film was the original "superhero" film, this one succeeds just as well in its technical proficiency and mastery of the subject matter throughout. I will be seeing this one repeatedly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
